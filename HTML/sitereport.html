            <h2 class="rom">Coding Experience</h2>
            <p>
                Thanks to my prior experience, I was familiar with HTML and CSS before starting this project. However,
                creating a professional-looking portfolio website required more than just basic knowledge. It was
                essential to use HTML and CSS efficiently and effectively to optimize the website's functionality and
                visual appeal. As a result, I had to carefully plan the design and layout of the website, using best
                practices and techniques to achieve the desired result.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my portfolio website, I used HTML and CSS to showcase my skills in web designing. Before starting
                actual coding, I sketched some ideas for the website's design and layout. I checked out some examples on
                the internet and took inspiration for the design of the website. Talking about the design of the
                website, I tried to keep it simple, clean and compact. I avoided making the website colorful and also
                minimized the use of pictures, except fot the portfoilo page.
            </p>
            <p>
                I choose black as the primary color for the website because I think it gives a sophisticated look;
                furthermore, I used contrasting colors that complemented black to create a visually appealing design.
                The website was divided into three major parts using &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;
                tags; in addition, I organized the content using &lt;section&gt; and &lt;div&gt; tags to create a
                cohesive and user-friendly layout. Not only did the organization of content using &lt;section&gt; and
                &lt;div&gt; tags enhance the user experience, but it also simplified the coding process for me as the
                designer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking back at the coding journey, I have to admit it wasn’t totally enjoyable. I often felt
                overwhelmed and frustrated during the coding process. Even though I followed the instructions provided
                in tutorials and documentation that I looked up on the internet, for some reason, the code just wouldn’t
                work. And, debugging the code proved to be a daunting task. While debugging one error another error used
                to pop up. However, after infinite loop of coding, debugging, debugging the new bug caused after
                debugging the previous one, I have finally completed the website. The website closely resembles my
                initial design concept though my CSS could have been much better.

            <h2 class="rom">Module Refelection</h2>
            <p>
                In this web development module, we learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. I realized that web
                development is not just about coding, but involves a great deal of planning and conceptualization. As
                the subject is vast and ever-changing, it's not practically possible for a lecturer to cover everything.
                Our teacher, Mr. Chirag Thapa, helped us by teaching the main topics and leaving the rest for us to
                explore on our own. He encouraged us to experiment and was always there to provide assistance when we
                had difficulties.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make our learning more engaging, he asked us to design a website on a topic of our choice. This
                practical experience was valuable because we could experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them.
                Consequently, we were more successful on our actual assignments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this module, I realized that web development requires self-learning, self-experimentation, and
                self-research. It's not just about following instructions but actively exploring the subject. I'm
                grateful for the solid foundation this module provided, which will help me continue my learning journey
                in web development.
